description:
 This check monitors the service health status of licensed Microsoft 365 services
 within a tenant.

 The check processes data collected by the {Microsoft 365} special agent, which
 queries the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve current service health information
 and any active service issues.

 Each monitored service can have multiple active issues, which are classified
 into different severity types:

 - {Incident}: Critical service disruptions affecting functionality

 - {Advisory}: Service degradations or minor issues with limited impact

 Issue classification thresholds are configurable through check parameters.
 When issues are present, the service displays counts of incidents and advisories
 in the summary, along with detailed information including issue titles, affected
 features, start times, and Microsoft issue IDs.

 Performance metrics track the number of active incidents and advisories for
 trending and alerting purposes.

 You must configure the {Microsoft 365} special agent to collect service health
 data from your Microsoft 365 tenant.

item:
 The name of the Microsoft 365 service as reported by the Service Health API.

discovery:
 One service is created automatically for each licensed Microsoft 365 service
 found in the tenant. Services are named "M365 health {service_name}" where
 {service_name} is reported by Microsoft. Only services with
 active licenses are discovered and monitored.
