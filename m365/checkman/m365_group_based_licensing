description:
 This check monitors group-based licensing errors within a Microsoft 365 tenant.
 Group-based licensing in Microsoft 365 allows administrators to assign licenses
 to Microsoft Entra ID groups instead of individual users, automatically
 managing license assignments when users are added or removed from groups.

 The check processes data collected by the {Microsoft 365} special agent, which
 queries the Microsoft Graph API to identify groups experiencing licensing errors.

 The service operates with two states:

 {OK}: No groups have licensing errors - all group-based license assignments
 are functioning correctly

 {CRIT}: One or more groups have licensing errors - license assignments may
 be failing for users in affected groups

 When errors are detected, the service provides detailed information including
 the group names and their corresponding Microsoft Entra ID group IDs to help
 administrators identify and resolve licensing issues.

 Prerequisites: You must configure the {Microsoft 365} special agent to collect group-based
 licensing data from your Microsoft 365 tenant.

discovery:
 One service named "M365 group-based licensing" is created automatically to
 monitor licensing errors across all groups in the Microsoft 365 tenant.
