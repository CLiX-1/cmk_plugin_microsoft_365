description:
 This check monitors Microsoft 365 license consumption and availability within
 a Microsoft 365 tenant. Each license SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) represents a
 specific Microsoft 365 product or service plan with a defined number of
 available licenses.

 The check processes data collected by the {Microsoft 365} special agent, which
 queries the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve licensing information for all
 SKUs in the tenant.

 License monitoring includes tracking consumption percentage and remaining
 available licenses, with configurable thresholds for warning and critical states:

 - {Absolute thresholds}: Alert when available licenses fall below specific numbers

 - {Percentage thresholds}: Alert when available licenses fall below specific percentages

 - {Over-licensing detection}: Alert only when more licenses are consumed than available

 The service displays consumption details, availability status, and license state
 information. Performance metrics are provided for graphing license usage trends.

 Microsoft 365 licenses have different states:

 {enabled}: The number of units that are enabled for the active subscription of
 the service SKU.

 {lockedOut}: The number of units that are locked out because the customer canceled
 their subscription of the service SKU.

 {suspended}: The number of units that are suspended because the subscription of
 the service SKU has been canceled. The units can't be assigned but
 can still be reactivated before they're deleted.

 {warning}: The number of units that are in warning status. When the subscription
 of the service SKU has expired, the customer has a grace period to
 renew their subscription before it's canceled (moved to a suspended state).

 Total available licenses include both enabled and warning licenses, as warning
 licenses remain functional during the grace period.

 You must configure the {Microsoft 365} special agent to collect licensing
 data from your Microsoft 365 tenant.

item:
 The Microsoft 365 license SKU name as reported by the Microsoft Graph API.
 SKU names are typically internal Microsoft identifiers like "VISIOCLIENT"
 or "THREAT_INTELLIGENCE".

discovery:
 One service is created automatically for each license SKU found in the
 Microsoft 365 tenant. Services are named "M365 SKU {sku_name}" where
 {sku_name} is the license SKU identifier.
